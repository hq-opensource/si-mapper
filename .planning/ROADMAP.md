# Roadmap: HVAC Reconstruction & Mapping

## Phase 1: Sequential Topological Reconstruction (Completed)
**Goal:** Build the foundation by extracting and placing geometry in the frontend.

- **Phase 1.1: Horizontal Duct Extraction**
    - [x] Create/Refine specialized agent for primary horizontal trunk identification.
    - [x] Implement "Grid Reading" tool for agents to understand current frontend state.
- **Phase 1.2: Vertical Duct & Connection Extraction**
    - [x] Create agent for mixing zones and vertical branches.
    - [x] Implement placement logic relative to horizontal trunks.
- **Phase 1.3: Equipment Placement & Alignment**
    - [x] Extract Fans, Coils, Humidifiers.
    - [x] Enforce grid alignment (Y-coordinate matching with parent ducts).
- **Phase 1.4: Engineering Review & Verification**
    - [x] Implement Review Agent to check connectivity (e.g., flow direction, sequence).
    - [x] Human-in-the-loop (HITL) verification pattern for final topology approval.

## Phase 2: Raw Information Extraction & Mapping (Current Focus)
**Goal:** Extract technical data from source files and map them as raw components to the frontend for human verification.

- **Phase 2.1: Infrastructure & MCP Tools**
    - [x] Implement `write_metadata` tool in `mcp_server/graphivac/metadata_tools.py`.
    - [x] Create `MetadataManager` in `mcp_server/graphivac/metadata_manager.py`.
    - [x] Verify `read_grid` integration with multimodal sub-agents.
    - [x] Implement `save_agent_state` in `agent/tools/state_tools.py` using `ToolContext.state`.
- **Phase 2.2: Specialized Raw Data Agents (Multimodal)**
    - [x] Create Bacnet Sub-Agent.
    - [ ] Create Control Sub-Agent.
    - [ ] Create Electricity Sub-Agent.
- **Phase 2.3: Iterative Technical Mapping Loop**
    - [ ] Implement the loop to process all grid equipment and attach raw technical metadata.
- **Phase 2.4: Human Verification (HITL)**
    - [ ] Human review of extracted raw data on the frontend before semantic processing.

## Phase 3: Semantic Graph Generation
**Goal:** Transform verified raw data into standardized ontologies (ASHRAE 223P, Haystack).

- **Phase 3.1: Ontology Mapping & Graph Construction**
- **Phase 3.2: Export Logic & Validation**
